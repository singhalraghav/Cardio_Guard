# Cardio_Guard
Cardio_Guard is a machine learning project that utilizes logistic regression to predict whether a personâ€™s heart is healthy or at risk of a heart attack based on key health indicators.


Project Overview

Cardio_Guard aims to assist in early detection of heart health issues by analyzing patient data to predict the likelihood of a heart attack. The model is trained using a dataset of cardiovascular-related attributes and outputs a binary classification indicating heart health status.


Features

Predicts heart health status (Healthy/At Risk) using logistic regression.
Analyzes key health metrics such as age, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and other cardiovascular risk factors.
Provides insights into risk factors contributing to the prediction.


Technologies Used

Programming Language: Python
Machine Learning Model: Logistic Regression
Libraries: Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib
Dataset: Cardiovascular health dataset


Model Performance

The logistic regression model is evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and the ROC-AUC score to ensure reliable predictions. Fine-tuning and feature engineering have been applied to optimize performance.

Future Enhancements

Incorporating other machine learning models like Random Forest and SVM for comparison.
Developing a web interface for easier access to the prediction model.
